## Publication

### **SCIENCE DIRECT JOURNAL - SRANK : Guiding Schema Selection in NoSQL Document Stores (Co-Author)**
### MTech - Computer Science (2022 - 2024)

This paper presents a model for evaluating schema alternatives in NoSQL document stores, emphasizing the importance of schema design for performance. It includes a four-phase process to analyze schema options and recommends the best choice based on a computed Schema Rank (SRank). A case study on a Hotel Reservation System demonstrates the model's effectiveness in optimizing query response time, storage efficiency, and overall performance.

### **IEEE CONFERENCE - Cost Model for Schema Choices: Performance and Trade Analysis (Author)**
### MTech - Computer Science (2022 - 2024)

This paper addresses the challenges of schema design in NoSQL databases by employing directed acyclic schema graphs and knowledge graphs to analyze field interdependencies in workload queries. It utilizes a Cost Model to estimate and identify optimal schemas, demonstrating that the proposed approach achieves shorter query execution times, lower latency, and improved maintainability. This significantly simplifies schema decision-making for users, a critical issue in the field for decades.
